# Schoolbook ## Kind of

## For small practises

1. Static node REST API
2. REST API with Postgres <- me likes
3. REST API with Atlas Mongo <- not for humans

Last school thing is index, previous have to mv to index to work or change in package.json

- -> npm run dev

- Atlas finds to be quite slow and tricky. Maeby old examples have something to do it too. Have to try this again for better experience.
